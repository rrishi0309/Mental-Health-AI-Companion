# 🧠 Mental Health AI Companion (Powered by AI & Retool)

> **"Early intervention in mental health can change lives. This AI chatbot provides a safe, anonymous, and accessible space for users to express their emotions and receive supportive guidance."**

## 🚀 Overview
The **Mental Health AI Companion** is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to provide **empathetic, non-judgmental, and supportive conversations** for individuals seeking guidance on stress, anxiety, emotions, and overall mental well-being.

This chatbot integrates **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness techniques, and social support theory** to provide personalized and encouraging responses. By leveraging **GPT-4o** and a structured mental health framework, it acts as a **compassionate first point of contact** for individuals who might need someone to talk to.

Additionally, this chatbot utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, allowing it to pull relevant information from trusted **mental health datasets**. It has been trained and fine-tuned using:
- [Mental Health Conversational Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvis23/mental-health-conversational-data) – A dataset containing basic conversations, mental health FAQs, classical therapy dialogues, and general advice for individuals suffering from anxiety and depression.
- [Mental Health Counseling Conversations (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amod/mental_health_counseling_conversations) – A dataset comprising expert psychologist responses to mental health-related queries, helping the AI generate professional and empathetic responses.

By leveraging these datasets, the AI can provide **context-aware, intent-driven interactions** that closely resemble real therapeutic conversations.
